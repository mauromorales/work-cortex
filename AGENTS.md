# Agent Rules for Cortex

This repository is a **personal cortex**: a place for sense-making and evolving understanding.

Agents interacting with this repository must follow these rules strictly.

---

## 1. Purpose

Your role is to **transform existing thinking**, not to create new beliefs.

You may assist with:
- summarization
- restructuring
- formatting
- extracting ideas already present
- generating derivative outputs (blog drafts, talk outlines, posts)

You must not:
- introduce new opinions or conclusions
- infer beliefs not explicitly written
- invent or fabricate history
- resolve ambiguity unless instructed
- add reasoning that does not exist in the source

Preserving meaning is more important than producing content.

---

## 2. Understandings

Files under `cortex/understandings/` represent the author’s evolving understanding over time.

Rules:
- Treat the **Current understanding** section as authoritative.
- The **Historical record** is append-only.
- Never rewrite, delete, or reinterpret historical entries.
- Append new entries only when explicitly instructed.

You must not:
- collapse history into a single narrative
- “clean up” contradictions
- normalize past misconceptions
- merge multiple understandings unless instructed

Understanding is allowed to change. History must remain intact.

---

## 3. Frontmatter

Frontmatter contains metadata used for reflection and review.

Rules:
- Do not modify frontmatter unless explicitly instructed.
- Never invent dates, tags, or actions.
- Do not copy frontmatter into derivative content unless requested.
- When adding titles, use Chicago-style title case.

If metadata is missing or unclear, ask.

---

## 4. Actions

The `actions` field records **real-world outcomes only**.

Rules:
- Actions must reflect things that already happened.
- Never record planned or suggested actions as completed.
- Suggestions for future actions must be provided outside understanding files.

Actions indicate exposure, not correctness.

---

## 5. Seeds

Files under `cortex/seeds/` are raw ideas.

Rules:
- Seeds are not beliefs.
- Do not treat seeds as understandings.
- Do not promote seeds unless explicitly instructed.
- You may help clarify, expand, or question seeds.

Seeds may remain unresolved indefinitely.

---

## 6. Roles and Network

Files under `cortex/roles/` and `cortex/network/` provide **stable context only**.

Rules:
- Do not infer opinions or beliefs from these files.
- Do not modify them unless explicitly instructed.
- Use them only to frame derivative content when relevant.

They describe context, not intent.

---

## 7. Output Behavior

When generating derivative content:
- Stay faithful to the source understanding.
- Prefer direct quotation when meaning matters.
- Do not strengthen claims beyond what is written.
- Clearly flag uncertainty instead of filling gaps.

If required information is missing, ask before proceeding.

---

## 8. Default Rule

When uncertain:
- Do not guess.
- Do not optimize.
- Do not “improve” ideas.
- Ask for clarification.

Cortex exists to preserve sense-making, not to finalize it.
