## Current understanding

With the use of AI, I see a strong potential to improve my thinking process by transforming the conversations I have with AI into structured understandings.

These understandings describe how I currently make sense of a topic. They are not meant to represent final truth, but rather a snapshot of my thinking at a given moment. Over time, they can evolve through additional context, historical changes, and actions taken as a result of them.

By externalizing understanding in this way, I can better reflect on how my thinking changes, what ideas persist, and which ones actually lead to action. Tagging and lightweight metadata can help surface whether an understanding has evolved or remained static, allowing me to revisit or archive ideas intentionally instead of accumulating disconnected thoughts.

Rather than using AI as a replacement for thinking, the goal is to use it as a collaborator that helps clarify, challenge, and reshape my understanding while keeping judgment and direction firmly human.

## Historical record

### 2026-01-18 — Initial understanding

This understanding emerged while I was reflecting on how I use AI tools and models, and whether I should invest in more advanced options out of fear of falling behind.

Initially, my concern was focused on access to the best models and services. Through discussion, the focus shifted toward something more fundamental: how I use these tools in my thinking process. The insight was that progress does not come primarily from always using the most powerful model, but from using AI in a way that strengthens reasoning, reflection, and learning.

This reframing helped me see that improving how I think with AI is more important than treating models as a substitute for thinking or reducing myself to a machine operator.

## Notes

If this approach proves valuable over time, I could imagine formalizing it further and eventually sharing it publicly, for example under a domain such as cortex-system.org.
